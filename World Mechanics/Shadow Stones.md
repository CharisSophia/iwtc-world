Shadow stones are **arcane medium-shifting artifacts**. They do not generate power or shadow on their own. Instead, they alter **where arcane magic is anchored**, relocating certain effects into shadow-space rather than strengthening them.

Shadow stones affect **arcane magic only**. They have **no effect on divine magic**, and no direct effect on psionics. Clerics, most Mentir, and most Tolanites are therefore unable to use the stones meaningfully. Any interaction with psionics occurs only indirectly, through changes to presence and perceptual context.

Their effects vary by the **school of arcane magic** routed through them:

- **Illusion (e.g., invisibility):**  
    Shadow stones relocate perceptual editing into shadow-space. The user becomes visually unseen as normal, but also partially withdrawn from shared perceptual and social context. Presence is thinned rather than masked, creating a subtle gap in the environment. The effect is binary and isolating rather than blended. Re-entry is often jarring. This use tends to increase separation rather than safety.
    
- **Abjuration (e.g., Pass Without Trace):**  
    Shadow stones extend protective wards into shadowed contexts. The user remains fully present, but the environment is discouraged from retaining evidence or attachment. Movement leaves little residue. This use is relationally stable and compatible with cooperation, trust, and continuity.
    
- **Evocation (e.g., Darkness):**  
    Shadow stones anchor the effect as a spatial domain rather than a concealment. Darkness becomes an asserted environment with altered rules, not an illusion. Users capable of operating within that domain experience increased clarity and agency rather than withdrawal.
    

Shadow stones do **not** erase sound, scent, heat, or physical disturbance. They do not inherently grant stealth, silence, or immunity to detection.

While shadow stones do not directly affect psionics, they **interfere with presence-dependent abilities** by thinning shared perceptual context when illusion-based effects are used. Psionic scans and mental communication may still function but lose depth, texture, and reliable calibration. This is most noticeable to users who rely heavily on constant mental feedback.

Victor is a special case. His mixed arcane training and latent psionic aptitude (likely tied to a Tolanite bloodline) allow him to use the stones, but also make him vulnerable to their indirect effects. When Victor routes arcane illusion through the stones, the resulting withdrawal degrades the mental reference frame his psionics rely on. This manifests as muted or flattened reads rather than outright failure, and is often misinterpreted as improved concealment.

Shadow stones reward **inhabiting shadow**, not withdrawing into it. They amplify the user’s underlying approach to power and presence. They do not correct misuse.
