# world_repository.yml
#
# Describes how a world's accumulated materials are organized.
# This includes where source materials are stored, where machine-generated
# work-in-progress outputs may be written, and which world descriptors apply.
#
# This file describes the structure of the world repository itself.
# It does not describe world lore, geography, or canon.
#

# ---------------------
# Minimum required info:
# - where does everything start?
# - what should be read?
# - where can output be written?
# ---------------------

# Absolute path to the root of the world's file structure.
# This directory contains all world content, metadata, and local working files.
# Paths in this file are resolved relative to this root.
# Example (macOS):
#   /Users/yourname/Documents/Campaign Directory
# Example (Windows):
#   C:\Users\yourname\Documents\Campaign Directory
world_root: /Users/charissophia/obsidian/Iron Wolf Trading Company

sources:
  # Where tools are allowed to read source materials from.
  # Multiple entries are allowed.
  # Relative paths are resolved under world_root unless an absolute path is given.
  #
  # The optional "type" field is a human-defined classification used to guide
  # chunking and indexing behavior. It is not inferred automatically.
  #
  # Common values include (but are not limited to):
  #   - auto_transcripts    : raw text transcripts from recorded sessions
  #   - pbp_transcripts     : play-by-post transcripts (e.g., Discord exports)
  #   - session_notes       : human-authored session notes
  #   - planning_notes      : planning or prep documents
  #   - recollections       : retrospective or reflective notes
  #
  # If no type is provided, the source will be treated as untyped and
  # default, format-based chunking rules will be applied.
