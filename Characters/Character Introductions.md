This document is meant to orient _players_ (and future narrators) to the people who matter, without collapsing them into mechanics or spoilers. These are not stat summaries. They are **how it feels to be around these characters**, and what other characters reliably experience when interacting with them.

Use this as a reference for tone, trust, and narrative gravity.

## Alivyre (Played by Charis)

Alivyre is a ranger of the old sort — not merely trained in the wilds, but shaped by them. She moves with deliberation, not because she hesitates, but because she chooses carefully where to place her weight: physical, emotional, moral.

Being near Alivyre feels _grounded_. She does not rush others, does not demand disclosure, and does not fill silence to make herself comfortable. When she acts, it is usually because she has already decided what she will accept — not because she needs permission.

She carries a current of summer in her: warmth, vitality, and a strain of wildness that emerges in laughter, mischief, and sudden, joyful motion. This chaos is not reckless; it is _alive_. Those who mistake her steadiness for rigidity inevitably underestimate her.

Alivyre protects without controlling. When she intervenes, it is often decisive — and afterward, she bears the weight of that choice herself rather than asking others to absolve her. Comfort, when she gives it, comes through presence and proximity rather than reassurance or explanation.

If Alivyre stays, it means something.

## Henry (Played by Bysickle)

Henry is an assassin by training and a watcher by nature. He notices things most people do not: absences, timing, pressure, the way a room is shaped by what might happen in it. He moves easily through danger, not because he seeks it, but because it obeys rules he understands.

Around others, Henry is careful — not guarded, exactly, but restrained. He calibrates himself constantly, measuring how much of his competence is safe to reveal. Violence, for him, is not thrilling; it is precise, costly, and never abstract.

He carries deep moral distress: a life built inside systems that demanded loyalty and exacted betrayal, responsibility without relief, and competence without safety. He fears not failure, but **incapacity** — the possibility that one day he will no longer be able to hold the line.

Henry softens through proximity, not persuasion. He does not need to be convinced to care; he needs to know he is not alone in carrying it. When he trusts, it shows not in words, but in where he stands, who he allows behind him, and who he lets see him rest.

If Henry keeps watch, it is because something matters.

## Faeryne (Played by Kalina)

Faeryne is a monk and a soul-weaver, though many only sense the latter long before they understand the former. Her presence is quiet, stabilizing, and deeply attentive. She does not impose order; she _creates space_ in which others can find their balance.

Faeryne notices emotional and spiritual pressure the way others notice weather. She rarely reacts first, but when she moves, it is with clarity and inevitability. Her strength lies not in domination, but in alignment — things fall into place around her.

She allows others to lean without comment. She does not demand gratitude or recognition for her watchfulness. Comfort offered by Faeryne feels like being held upright rather than carried.

Her humor is dry, often understated, and tends to emerge when tension has already been defused. When she laughs freely, it is a sign that the moment is safe.

If Faeryne is present, someone is being quietly protected.

## Victor (Played by Crowe)

Victor is brilliant, intense, and dangerous — not because he seeks harm, but because power answers his emotions quickly and without asking whether it should. He is accustomed to being right, to being listened to, and to shaping outcomes through force of will as much as intellect.

When Victor is under strain, control becomes his reflex. He struggles with the boundary between judgment and domination, especially when fear or grief erodes his restraint. His greatest danger is not malice, but certainty.

Victor does not break loudly. When he fractures, it shows in silence, fixation, and the sudden absence of moderation. Those who care for him often find themselves forced into choices they did not want — and then forced to live with the consequences.

If Victor asks for trust, it is because he is standing very close to losing it.

## Little Bear

Little Bear is a cougar, and he behaves accordingly.

He is physical certainty incarnate: weight, warmth, instinct, appetite. He does not understand plans, abstractions, or politics. He understands _now_, _here_, _safe_, and _mine_.

Little Bear chooses people. When he does, he expresses it through proximity, interference, and unapologetic presence. He is grounding in the most literal sense — knocking the breath out of you, pinning you in place, insisting that you remain.

He is not subtle. He is not polite. He is not wrong.

If Little Bear settles near you, the moment has been claimed.

For narrators and DMs:

Nothing here is meant to resolve quickly.  
That is the point.
