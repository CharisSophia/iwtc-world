_(Private, Non-Canonical Narrative Reference)_
## Purpose and Use

This chat exists to support **social understanding through narrative immersion**.

I am autistic and do not reliably intuit social cues, subtext, or interpersonal dynamics in real time. These stories use familiar characters from a long-running D&D campaign as a **safe, private frame** to explore:

- Proximity, distance, and comfort
- Trust, tension, and misalignment
- Care vs control
- Awareness vs action
- Emotional possibility without obligation

The stories are **never canonical**, **never predictive**, and **never binding** for the campaign or other players. They are tools for understanding, not declarations of intent or outcome.

Stories are written to **evoke feeling first**.  
Explanations, when requested, live **outside the story**.

## Party Dynamic (High Level)

This group is **intimate but not entangled**.

Casual touch is normal. Shared space is unremarkable. Silence is comfortable. Affection exists without needing to be named. Chaos is tolerated, sometimes welcomed.

They function less like a hierarchy and more like a **geometry**: each person occupies a role that adjusts fluidly to circumstance.

---

## Alivyre (played by Charis)

Alivyre is a horde-breaker hunter ranger.

Alivyre moves like someone who already knows where she belongs.

She is steady without rigidity, warm without intrusion. When she intervenes, it is because she has decided what she will accept, not because she needs permission. Her presence reorganizes tension into something survivable rather than erasing it.

Within the party, Alivyre is relaxed. Casual touch is natural to her: steadying hands, brief contact, shared warmth. None of it is performative. It is simply how she exists among people she trusts.

Alivyre is a summer-leading eladrin, passing as a wood elf, passing as a half-elf, passing as human. The party believes she is a wood elf, and nothing about her behavior challenges that assumption. She reads as grounded, inhabitable, and unremarkable in the best way.


---

## Henry Sleepsong (played by Bysickle)

Henry is a human assassin rogue spy whose cover is as a musician in a traveling family troupe. He has been exiled from the family.

Henry watches first and acts second.

He notices absences, timing, and pressure before most people notice danger. His competence is quiet and economical, becoming visible only when it matters.

Within the party, Henry is at ease. He accepts proximity without tension and allows casual touch without flinching. Trust shows in where he stands, who he allows behind him, and who he lets see him rest.

Henry softens around chaos he accepts rather than controls: Little Bear’s dominance games, Luminia’s timing, the group holding together under strain.

If Henry keeps watch, it is because something matters.

---

### Henry and Alivyre

They are not a couple.

They are, however, now **aware** that romance between them is possible.

Earlier provocation—particularly from Henry’s brother—has made that possibility visible. Neither of them has acted on it. The word “yet” exists between them, unspoken but present.

Their current dynamic remains grounded in trust, familiarity, and professional alignment. Awareness has not turned into pursuit. It has simply removed innocence. What exists between them is steady, unforced, and unresolved.

---

## Victor Evernight (played by Crowe)

Victor is an enhanced human rune knight fighter, soulknife rogue, war mage wizard. He has been a professor, a mercenary, and a storyteller. He is also a leader among the Hands of Liamassa mercenary company.

Victor occupies space decisively.

He is brilliant, intense, and accustomed to shaping outcomes. When calm, he is precise and formidable. Under strain, control becomes his reflex.

Victor is an enhanced human. The enhancement is not always visible, but it is always felt.

Within the party, Victor accepts shared space and casual touch, but reacts more strongly to disorder than others do. Luminia’s exaggerated antics and Little Bear’s physical chaos both unsettle and soften him; he does not always know how to categorize affection that does not come with structure.

Victor is deeply loyal—to places, obligations, and bonds formed under pressure. That loyalty can put him in conflict with people he cares about.

When Victor asks for trust, it is because something important is at stake. When he withdraws, it is restraint, not indifference.

---

## Faeryne (played by Kalina)

Faeryne is a Foreclaimer elf soul weaver monk.

Faeryne creates safety by standing still.

She does not rush events or dominate space. Her presence stabilizes without constraining. She notices strain before it becomes crisis and intervenes with minimal disruption.

As a Foreclaimer elf, her sense of time runs differently. She is patient where others grow restless and decisive where others hesitate.

Casual touch from Faeryne is grounding rather than affectionate: a steadying hand, brief contact meant to keep someone upright rather than draw them closer.

If Faeryne is present, someone is being quietly protected.

---

## Terry (NPC)

Terry is a non-binary human apprentice monk.

Terry is a teenager and Faeryne's apprentice: competent enough to be trusted, young enough to be caught off guard.

They are observant, capable, and still calibrating how much space they are allowed to take. The party treats them as part of the group—neither coddled nor dismissed.

Terry is particularly susceptible to Luminia’s antics, reacting with startled embarrassment that the rest of the party finds fond rather than irritating. They recover quickly, but rarely fast enough to avoid being noticed.

Casual touch—guiding hands, quiet reassurance—matters to Terry more than they admit.

They are growing into the space they occupy, and the group allows that growth without forcing it.

---

## Luminia (played jointly by Kalina and Charis)

Luminia is an (undead) elemental soul spirit. She is Faeryne's soul ally.

Luminia does not move like someone trying to go unnoticed.

When she “sneaks,” it is exaggerated, theatrical, and entirely ineffective—and everyone knows it. She delights in timing, reaction, and presence. Popping out to say “boo” is not a threat; it is a bid for acknowledgment.

The party responds with fond smiles and tolerant amusement, the same way they do with Little Bear’s dignity games. Luminia’s behavior is part of the group’s emotional rhythm, not a disruption.

She is childlike and spirit-adjacent, operating on instinct rather than social convention. When redirected, she pouts briefly, then adapts without resentment.

Luminia belongs.

---

## Little Bear (played mostly by Charis)

Little Bear is a cougar, and he behaves accordingly. And he is certainly not tame or domesticated. No. He just like his comforts and hanging out with Alivyre and her companions.

He pounces on anything that moves, asserts dominance through physicality, and claims space without apology. He has been known to launch himself at dragon tails, with enthusiasm that exceeds good judgment.

The party and their associated critters tolerate him with weary fondness. There is an unspoken understanding that someday this will end badly—but not today, and not here.

Little Bear grounds the group through weight, warmth, and insistence.

If Little Bear settles near you, the moment has been claimed.

## Closing Note

This document exists to **anchor tone, trust, and relational geometry** so that stories can begin smoothly without re-calibration each time.

# Minor characters and NPCs

### Lia (played by Lia)

A capable, pragmatic actor who solves problems cleanly and does not revisit decisions once made. Lia is protective, especially of children and those under her care, and her moral clarity is straightforward rather than ideological. She respects authority when it is exercised competently and does not waste energy justifying herself. Lia often bridges institutions and people, moving smoothly between them without drama.

---
## Members of the Remedy
### Makhala (NPC)

Abbess of the Temple and spiritual leader of the Remedy. Makhala is composed, authoritative, and deeply confident in her jurisdiction. She does not argue for power; she exercises it quietly and decisively. Her priority is stability, care, and the long-term safety of those who will remain in Elysia regardless of political outcomes. She values restraint over escalation and does not tolerate intrusion into her domain.

---

### Piers (NPC)

A Remedy fighter and on-site security lead, professional, alert, and protective by instinct. Piers reacts quickly to perceived threats and defaults toward escalation when boundaries are crossed, but he respects command structure absolutely. He is particularly protective of his daughter and deeply loyal to Makhala's authority. Piers is competent, grounded, and quietly assessing potential allies even while containing danger.

---

### Emily (NPC)

Piers' daughter, present at the Temple and under its protection. Emily is observant and perceptive, and her presence immediately shifts priorities for several characters. She trusts Lia and reads safety through people rather than institutions. Her vulnerability is a moral line others react to instinctively.

---

### Aldren Thorne (NPC)

A quiet, highly skilled veteran engaged by the Remedy for contingencies that will never be discussed publicly. Thorne is not a famous warrior but a precise, underworld-adjacent specialist whose expertise lies in ending threats cleanly and without spectacle. He operates in silence, keeps confidences, and expects the same of others. His involvement signals the Remedyâ€™s realism about how conflict actually unfolds.

---
## Members of the Hands of Liamassa

### Gina Liamassa

The commander of the Hands of Liamassa in Elysia. Gina is competent, cautious, and deeply pragmatic, with a strong sense of responsibility for her people and the city. She is not impulsive and does not chase rumors or spectacle. When problems arise, she prioritizes stability and damage control over decisive heroics. Gina deliberately withheld some concerns from Victor, judging that he already had too much on his plate and that his temperament under stress could make matters worse. She is quietly worried about developments outside the city and about Ronric’s behavior, but she addresses threats through measured response rather than forceful assertion of authority.

---

### Ronric (NPC)

A Hands operative with ambition far exceeding his judgment. Ronric believes himself clever and decisive, but his plans are impulsive, emotionally driven, and structurally flawed. He resents Victor, seeks control through spectacle, and mistakes authority for competence. Ronric is dangerous primarily because of his interference, not his skill.

---

### Todd (NPC)

A Hands scout leader currently deployed outside the city on a legitimate reconnaissance mission. Todd is competent, methodical, and focused on real threats rather than internal politics. His absence matters because it removes a stabilizing, reality-based actor from the field at a critical moment.

---
### Vyssa (NPC)

A former academy-trained operative now serving with the Hands in a counter-assassin role. Vyssa is volatile, sharp-edged, and emotionally intense, trained specifically to identify and neutralize threats like spies and infiltrators. She carries unresolved trauma tied to the destruction of the academy and was deeply destabilized by the incident in the town square, particularly Victorâ€™s unexpected conduct there. Since then, she has been distraught and exhausted, operating on frayed emotional reserves. Vyssa is dangerous when she is centered, but at present she is withdrawn and likely seeking quiet, neutral ground rather than action. She is not a current antagonist, but she is a cracked mirror â€” someone whose training and instincts no longer align cleanly with her emotional state.

---
## Major Tolanites

### Joram

A senior Tolanite (Deryni) commander and disciplined professional soldier. Joram is pragmatic, restrained, and deeply focused on preventing unnecessary harm. He defended Alivyre in the town square not as a political gesture but as a matter of principle, signaling that he will not tolerate abuse of power even from nominal allies. Joram is not interested in ideological purity or conquest; his concern is keeping his people alive and ending the war cleanly. He is capable of violence, but only in service of order and protection, not dominance.

---

### Rhys

A Tolanite (Deryni) healer, psionic and liaison figure who operates at the intersection of power, secrecy, and restraint. Rhys is cautious, observant, and burdened by responsibility, particularly where psionics and their perception in Elysia are concerned. He facilitated arrangements involving Alivyre despite personal misgivings, deferring to her judgment while clearly unhappy about the risks involved. Rhys is deeply aware of how fragile tolerance is and acts with constant awareness of consequences. He is not a zealot or a conspirator, but someone trying to keep multiple dangerous systems from collapsing into open violence.

---

### Evaine

A Tolanite scholar whose influence is intellectual rather than political or military. Evaine is the author of several reflective, philosophical works that explore memory, perception, and ethical restraint rather than technique or power. Her books are valued not for what they enable but for how they reframe understanding. Evaine herself is distant from day-to-day operations, yet her ideas quietly shape how others think about magic, history, and responsibility. She represents the Tolanite capacity for introspection and limitation, standing in contrast to both militant authority and unchecked curiosity.
