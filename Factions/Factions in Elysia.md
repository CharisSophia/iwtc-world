### Hands of Liamassa

The city’s primary external defense and monster-hunting organization. The Hands are tasked with keeping Elysia safe from threats beyond the walls and pride themselves on practical competence. They are not a unified ideological body; internal dynamics vary widely by squad and leader. The Hands tend to view the Thieves’ Guild as part of their sphere of influence and can be possessive of that relationship. While effective in the field, they are vulnerable to internal disruption when personalities like Ronric attempt to use authority for personal leverage rather than protection.

### The Remedy

A religious and humanitarian order centered in the Temple, operating the hospital, monastery, and critical storage infrastructure beneath the complex. The Remedy prioritizes care, stability, and long-term survivability over political victory. They expect to remain in Elysia regardless of how the war resolves and plan accordingly. While not openly militant, they quietly prepare for unrest and operate with a realistic understanding of violence and power. Their authority is jurisdictional rather than coercive, and they do not hesitate to enforce boundaries within their domain.

### Tolanites

A foreign faction engaged in the war against the king, operating in Elysia with limited presence and specific objectives. The Tolanites are not unified by ideology so much as by necessity. Their leadership prioritizes ending the war and minimizing collateral harm, not reshaping Elysian society. They have no interest in long-term expansion within the city and maintain only minimal infrastructure there. While allied with the Remedy in practical terms, their motivations are distinct: once the conflict ends, they will leave, while others must live with the aftermath.
